- This thermometer is based on arduino UNO R3.
- The temperature is shown through a LCD 16*2.
- The buzzer sounds an alarm when the temperature exceeds the standard level (60*C).
- The range of this thermometer is from -55C to 125C.
- The image shows that the sensor is TMP36, but in reality, it is DS18B20.
- There are some different in connecting the temperature sensor DS18B20:
  - GND -> (-)
  - VCC -> (+)
  - DAT -- to Digital 2 -- resistor (4k7) -- (+) // on a row on breadboard
